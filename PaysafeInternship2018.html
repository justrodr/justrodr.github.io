                    I spent the Summer of 2018 in Sofia, Bulgaria. I was a software
                    engineering intern at Paysafe Group, a multinational payments
                    company. I spent my time building and implementing a web
                    application that allows team managers in Paysafe's Bulgarian
                    Office (over 900 employees) to write team progress reports,
                    update Paysafe's Atlassian Jira database, and accurately
                    delegate tasks.

                <p class="post_paragraph">
                    In my free time, I learned to speak Bulgarian
                    (out of necesity), I learned more about mobile development from
                    one of my co-workers at Paysafe, and I even got to travel around
                    and adventure. The picture to the left is from my first solo skydive. Getting my skydiving license has
                    been
                    a dream of mine for a long time, and this was the first milestone. This was my first time to Eastern
                    Europe,
                    and I went alone without knowing anyone there.

                  What propelled me
                  to venture to Bulgaria was that I was told that Paysafe's main
                  software development force and top developers were stationed in the Sofia
                  office. I have an insatiable appetite to learn, so it was a no-brainer
                  decision to make the trip from Texas. My goal for the Summer was to
                  double my coding knowledge and capabilities. My experience was an
                  amazing adventure. Many challenges were faced both inside and outside
                  of the office. From working with team managers to develop the best
                  product to overcoming language barriers to even suffering a broken foot,
                  I not only accomplished my goal to improve my coding skills, but I also
                  grew as an individual.
