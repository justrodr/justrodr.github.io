        <h2 class="post_title">How I Got Into Software Engineering and iOS</h2>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          At my core, I love using creativity to positively impact people’s lives.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          The very first thing that I wanted to be, growing up, was a chef and restaurateur. From a young age I loved watching chefs on Youtube and TV. I loved the creative process. Manifesting creative expressions into dishes, meals, and restaurants was so fascinating to me. In 7th and 8th grade, I spent my Summers working as an apprentice to a well-known sushi and molecular gastronomy chef in Orlando FL. Though I loved working in the restaurant, I couldn’t see myself doing that as a profession.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          In high school, I got interested in industrial design. Once again, I found something that was highly creative, and that affected people intimately. I attended an industrial design Summer course at the College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning at the University of Cincinnati. I loved it, and set my sights on studying industrial design in college.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          Later on I decided to study the more technical side of industrial design, by going to engineering school and then studying industrial design in grad school.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          While in high school, I started finding myself interested in technology and startups. I did a ton of networking and found a startup in San Francisco that would have me as a go-for intern. I lived with the founder of the company in his apartment in Union Square, and I learned about product design, and the UX design process.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          I ended up attending college enrolled in engineering. I started as a mechanical engineer, but later found myself enjoying my small Matlab coding assignments. I loved my time interning in tech, and now that I found myself enjoying coding, I decided to change my engineering track to computer science.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
          In the past few years, I’ve been honing my skills as an iOS developer. I love iOS because of its proximity to the product designers, and to the users. I love building apps that make a difference in people’s lives.
