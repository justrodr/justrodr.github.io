                I had the privelege of competing in two Aggies Invent Competitions.
                Aggies Invent is like an entrepreneurial engineering hackathon
                at Texas A&M University. In my second time competing, my team brought innovation
                to the construction industry by developing a concrete formula that utilizes
                recycled plastic. We came up with a business plan and sales pitch, and
                we presented our ideas to a panel of industry experts. My role in the team
                was to conduct market research, and develop all of the presentation materials
                (charts, graphs, presentation slides, video, etc...).
