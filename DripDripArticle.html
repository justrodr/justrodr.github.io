            This is DripDrip! DripDrip is an app that helps people stay hydrated by creating a gamified social framework
            where
            friends can remind each other to drink water, and form teams to build new habits together.
        </p>
        <h3>The App</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            There are hundreds of hydration reminder apps on the App Store. Unlike the majority of those apps, DripDrip
            relies on its user community to send reminders instead timers. In DripDrip, users send random funny
            reminders to
            drink water to each other. Those messages are presented to the recipient in the form of push notifications,
            and chat messages in the app. The app calculates a healthy target water volume that users should drink
            daily, based on their weight. When users receive a reminder message, they are prompted to drink some water,
            and log how much water they drank in the app. Users who complete complete their target water goal add to
            their personal DripDrip score, and contribute to their groups scores as well.
        </p>

                <img src="LogWater.jpg" class="small_pic app_screenshot">
            </div>
            <div class="two_col_right_col">
                <img src="Group.jpg" class="small_pic app_screenshot">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            Along with keeping a personal score, DripDrip Groups are another great way for users to stay motivated in
            maintaining their healthy habit. Groups are like those running groups that people join to train for 10k's
            and half marathons. Friends can form a group, and work together to earn a group score. Group score is the
            average of its members DripDrip scores. Group members can keep
            track of which members have and have not completed their goal for the day. Similar to running groups,
            DripDrip groups help members stay committed, and provide a stronger community that motivates each other.

        <h3>The Tech</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            DripDrip is an MVVM structured app written in Swift. DripDrip uses a Firebase backend, with cloud functions
            written in Typescript. The original app was ideated and prototyped by David Ho and Justin Rodriguez, and the
            latest version of the app was written and released by Justin Rodriguez. The app is fully opensource. It is
            encouraged that young iOS developers utilize DripDrip's source code to make their own creations. As a young
            iOS developer myself, I learned many useful skills in app development while writing DripDrip. Currently, I
            am
            helping a younger computer science student create their own app with DripDrip's sourcecode as a starting
            point. This process will later be documented as a step by step guide for other young developers to follow.

        <h3>The Business</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            My hope for DripDrip, along with helping people have a laugh and create healthy habits, is for it to be a
            cash-flow-positive business. DripDrip has over 200 users, and as the user base grows, I believe that some
            water, and water bottle companies might be interested in advertising to a bunch of motivated water drinkers.
            Advertisments would not detract from the user experience as they would be presented as one of the random
            reminder messages that users send to each other. Messages like "Drink _____ water. It's better" and "Bro I
            think you need a ____ water bottle" along with a purchase link, could help create brand awareness and drive
            sales.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            I purposely designed my database to be as lean as possible in order to minimize my server and database
            costs. Currently, my personal Venmo account is in the app, and DripDrip is fully supported by donations.
            Even small donations help me accomodate hundreds more users on the app.
