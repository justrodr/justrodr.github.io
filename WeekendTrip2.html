              This is Weekend Trip for iOS! I originally made Weekend Trip as a website for an American Airlines challenge at a hackathon. I loved the idea so much that I decided to make it an iOS app. Weekend Trip iOS leverages the Skyscanner API to provide the cheapest round trip from your origin for the upcoming this weekend. This app is designed to empower spontaneous adventure-seeking people to travel more with an extremely easy interface. When the user enters their origin, Weekend Trip makes concurrent requests for round trip flights to about 40 of the top US destinations. Once the responses are collected and the parsing is finished, Weekend Trip displays the destination, price, and a "book now" button that leads to a webview to purchase the ticket from Skyscanner.
