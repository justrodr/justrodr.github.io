          Through rigorous networking and incredible luck, I was able to
          land an externship at Adobe in 2015. I had emailed all of my
          parents' friends, my firends' parents, and the faculty and staff asking
          to send me contacts that they might have of people who work in
          Silicon Valley. At this time I already had a strong desire to
          pursue a career in tech, and I was determined to create learning
          opportunities. When I finally got in contact with an employee at
          Adobe and asked about opportunities that they might know of, one
          of Adobe's executive's son was also looking to do an externship
          at Adobe. Serendipitously, I was able to join him for his
          externship. We learned about several different departments in Adobe,
          and got a true sense of what working at a large tech company would
          be like. I learned how I could create opportunities through hustle
          and grit.
