                Through rigorous networking and incredible luck, I was able to
                land an externship at Adobe in 2015. I had emailed all of my
                parents' friends, my firends' parents, and the faculty and staff asking
                to send me contacts that they might have of people who work in
                Silicon Valley. At this time I already had a strong desire to
                pursue a career in tech, and I was determined to create learning
                opportunities. When I finally got in contact with an employee at
                Adobe and asked about opportunities that they might know of, one
                of Adobe's executive's son was also looking to do an externship
                at Adobe. Serendipitously, I was able to join him for his
                externship. We learned about several different departments in Adobe,
                and got a true sense of what working at a large tech company would
                be like. I learned how I could create opportunities through hustle
                and grit.
