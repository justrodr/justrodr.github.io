            I spent the Summer of 2018 in Sofia, Bulgaria. I was a software
            engineering intern at Paysafe Group, a multinational payments
            company. I spent my time building and implementing a web
            application that allows team managers in Paysafe's Bulgarian
            Office (over 900 employees) to write team progress reports,
            update Paysafe's Atlassian Jira database, and accurately
            delegate tasks.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            In my free time, I learned to speak Bulgarian
            (out of necesity), I learned more about mobile development from
            one of my co-workers at Paysafe, and I even got to travel around
            and adventure. The picture to the left is from my first solo skydive. Getting my skydiving license has
            been
            a dream of mine for a long time, and this was the first milestone. This was my first time to Eastern
            Europe,
            and I went alone without knowing anyone there.

          What propelled me
          to venture to Bulgaria was that I was told that Paysafe's main
          software development force and top developers were stationed in the Sofia
          office. I have an insatiable appetite to learn, so it was a no-brainer
          decision to make the trip from Texas. My goal for the Summer was to
          double my coding knowledge and capabilities. My experience was an
          amazing adventure. Many challenges were faced both inside and outside
          of the office. From working with team managers to develop the best
          product to overcoming language barriers to even suffering a broken foot,
          I not only accomplished my goal to improve my coding skills, but I also
          grew as an individual.
