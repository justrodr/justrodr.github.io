                In my freetime at school, I teach myself Swift and mobile development.
                I don't own a mac computer which is necessary to code in Swift, so
                I spend extra hours on campus using one of the two mac computers hidden
                in the back of one of the campus computer labs. I made a simple Tic Tac Toe
                game because I was inspired to help people interact in
                medial times when they would normally just recluse themselves by doing
                something menial on their phone. I learned how difficult it is to publish
                an app on the App Store (especially when you don't own the mac).
                I was driven to go through the entire process of getting the app
                published for the pride of being able to say that I have an app on the
                App Store. I am proud of how the game turned out, and I am looking to
                publish more apps in the near future.
