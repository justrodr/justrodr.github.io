            Summer of 2019, I worked as an iOS engineer on Yahoo Fantasy Sports at Verizon Media. I had a blast! The
            team is as fun as you would imagine a fantasy sports app team would be. I got to contribute a lot to the
            newest game in Yahoo’s suite of fantasy sports games, Best Ball. I developed several new features from
            scratch for Best Ball, and I had the honor of serving as the release manager for the new game. I got to
            work in each layer of the iOS app’s architecture, and collaborated with the backend team to ensure
            efficient use of API requests.
        </p>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            Along with my contributions to Best Ball, I also helped maintain the Yahoo Fantasy Sports app working in
            Swift and Objective C. I wrote unit tests for the new Best Ball models. And I helped initiate the
            implementation of dark mode. At the end of my internship, my teammate (also an intern) and I put
            together a presentation, and displayed our work to executives and team leaders at Verizon Media. He and
            I were also in charge of the team launch party, which we like to assert that it was the greatest launch
            party ever. We maxed out our budget on music, food, and drinks, and people are still talking about our
            party today.
