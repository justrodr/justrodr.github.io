                Summer of 2019, I worked as an iOS engineer on Yahoo Fantasy Sports at Verizon Media. I had a blast! The
                team is as fun as you would imagine a fantasy sports app team would be. I got to contribute a lot to the
                newest game in Yahoo’s suite of fantasy sports games, Best Ball. I developed several new features from
                scratch for Best Ball, and I had the honor of serving as the release manager for the new game. I got to
                work in each layer of the iOS app’s architecture, and collaborated with the backend team to ensure
                efficient use of API requests.

                Along with my contributions to Best Ball, I also helped maintain the Yahoo Fantasy Sports app working in
                Swift and Objective C. I wrote unit tests for the new Best Ball models. And I helped initiate the
                implementation of dark mode. At the end of my internship, my teammate (also an intern) and I put
                together a presentation, and displayed our work to executives and team leaders at Verizon Media. He and
                I were also in charge of the team launch party, which we like to assert that it was the greatest launch
                party ever. We maxed out our budget on music, food, and drinks, and people are still talking about our
                party today.
