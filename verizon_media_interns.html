                I am currently working as an iOS intern on the Yahoo Fantasy Sports team at Verizon Media. Most of my
                work is contributing to the new Yahoo Fantasy Sports game, Best Ball. My work is very exciting as Best
                Ball is the first new fantasy sports game for Yahoo in 9 years or so. So far, I have developed several
                screens and flows for the game, and I am serving as the release manager for the release of Best Ball on
                iOS later this month. I have also worked on fixing bugs and maintaining the existing app. Most of my
                work has been in Swift and Objective-C.
