                My goal is to have many different companies under the overarching parent
                brand - Braeswood. The mission of Braeswood is to add value
                to people's lives effectively and simply. In the same air as Pareto's law, I
                believe that many products, services, and industries can become
                more valuable and effective by simplifying the process,
                and focusing on the user. I have always been entrepreneurial growing up.
                Some notable businesses of mine from my childhood are an origami business
                in the 1st grade, a duct tape wallet business in the 5th grade, and
                a downhill longboarding company in 10th grade. More recently, I have
                been working on launching successful FBA product lines. From home decor
                posters to makeup accessories, I have many failed attempts. Lately,
                I have been working on launching a drumming product line that would
                simplify drummers' shopping experience by providing fewer higher quality
                options for drum sticks, and drum equipment, but unfortunately, I did not do enough market research, and
                I learned the hard way that there isn't a very strong online market for drum equipment. I was able to
                get my drum key listing to be on the first page for its keyword on Amazon, and I did make a profit a few
                of the months that my listing was live, but ultimately, I figured out that there wasn't enough traffic
                for the business to be sustainable. I am continuing to learn, and I have already pivoted to my next
                entrepreneurial endeavor. Hopefully this time I will 1) Do more sufficient market research, and 2) Use
                my skills in programming to my advantage.
