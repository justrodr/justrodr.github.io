                This was a project that I worked on while participating in the Texas A&M hackathon, TAMUHack. I love to
                travel, but, like a lot of people, I find it difficult to find the time and money to travel. As a
                student, I really only have Spring, Summer, Winter break, and weekends available, and those are the most
                expensive times to travel. I also struggle with not being aware of all of the amazing destinations that
                exist in the world. This was a possible solution that I built that utilized the American Airlines API to
                present the user with the cheapest round trip from their origin for the upcoming weekend. There are a
                lot of really awesome and powerful flight search sites and apps on the market, but I still felt there
                was a market that wasn't being served by these companies. Those people were like me, students with
                little time, little resources, and lack of awareness of cool destinations. This site was meant to
                address this problem by providing an extremely simple interface that takes out all of the hard work of
                finding a destination and a good price. And it also promotes spontinaity and adventure.

            </p>

                I am currently doing market research to see how I can adjust this idea to better serve young travelers.
                My hope is that I will be able to help millions of young travelers around the world travel the world
                without breaking their budget.
