                    I worked as a UI design intern for One Inc (the company
                    behind After School App) in the Summers of 2015 and 2017. I
                    worked to develop products that catelyze high school and college
                    students to connect with each other.
                    A feature that I worked on
                    matches high school students by asking questions like
                    "Would you go eat cake in chinatown with ____?" If both students
                    asked that question about each other answered yes, they would be
                    matched. In the first 3 months after being published on the After
                    School App, the matching feature made over 500k matches. I also
                    aided in the ideation and design of new products for the One Inc.

                <p class="post_paragraph">
                    I had the privilege to work for One Inc both in the first year of
                    the After School App re-release, and in the later stage of a startup.
                    I learned a lot about the tech industry, and startups.

                    In my freetime,
                    I improved my iOS development skills with one of my co-workers and
                    other interns around San Francisco (where my internships were). The
                    biggest impact this experience had on me was that I realized how big
                    of an impact I could have on people by creating a good product.
                    My experience was highly rewarding, and it spiked my drive to improve
                    more people's lives.
