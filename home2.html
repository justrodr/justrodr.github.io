                                Before going into product, I worked as an iOS Engineer on the Yahoo Fantasy Sports App,
                                both as an intern as well as a new grad employee. I got to launch several cool projects
                                including Best Ball, a simplified full season game for novice players, and Yahoo Fantasy
                                Plus, a paid subscription with enhanced data and features for advanced fantasy sports
                                players.

                            <p>
                                This is an idea I've worked on several times with different teams and solo. It's an AC
                                filter subscription service for private landlords. One of the biggest costs private
                                landlords who invest in residential real estate can incur is fixing a broken AC, and
                                there's an easy preventative solution: change the air filters regularly. The problem is
                                that tenants are not incentivized to change the filters themselves. AC Angel aimed to
                                bridge this gap by first developing a way for homeowners to regularly deliver AC filters
                                to each of their properties, and to provide instructions and rewards for tenants.

                                developed a Scrum task assignment assistant and automated reporting tool for 900+
                                employees. That Summer was particularly tranformative for me because I traveled there
                                alone and knowing no one, I broke my foot, and had to learn how to navigate a new
                                language and culture on my own.

                                I worked as a UI design intern for One Inc (the company behind After School App) in the
                                Summers of 2015 and 2017. I worked to develop products that catelyze high school and
                                college students to connect with each other. A feature that I worked on matches high
                                school students by asking questions like "Would you go eat cake in chinatown with ____?"
                                If both students asked that question about each other answered yes, they would be
                                matched. In the first 3 months after being published on the After School App, the
                                matching feature made over 500k matches. I also aided in the ideation and design of new
                                products for the One Inc.

                                like an entrepreneurial engineering hackathon at Texas A&M University. In my second time
                                competing, my team brought innovation to the construction industry by developing a
                                concrete formula that utilizes recycled plastic. We came up with a business plan and
                                sales pitch, and we presented our ideas to a panel of industry experts. My role in the
                                team was to conduct market research, and develop all of the presentation materials
                                (charts, graphs, presentation slides, video, etc...).
