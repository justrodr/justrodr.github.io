    <p id="about">
        I (Justin Rodriguez) am a computer science major and art minor at 
        Texas A&M University, graduating May, 2020. I am an aspiring 
        user experience engineer and entrepreneur amongst other things.
        My career goal is to bring focus and freedom to peopleâ€™s lives 
        through technology and innovation.

        <h2>Paysafe Group</h2>
        <p>
            I spent the Summer of 2018 in Sofia, Bulgaria. I was a software 
            engineering intern at Paysafe Group, a multinational payments
            company. I spent my time building and implementing a web 
            application that allows team managers in Paysafe's Bulgarian
            Office (over 900 employees) to write team progress reports,
            update Paysafe's Atlassian Jira database, and accurately 
            delegate tasks. In my free time, I learned to speak Bulgarian
            (out of necesity), I learned more about mobile development from
            one of my co-workers at Paysafe, and I even got to travel around
            and adventure. This was my first time to Eastern Europe,
            and I went alone without knowing anyone there. What propelled me
            to venture to Bulgaria was that I was told that Paysafe's main
            software development and top developers were stationed in the Sofia
            office. I have an insatiable appetite to learn, so it was a no-brainer
            decision to make the trip from Texas. My goal for the Summer was to
            double my coding knowledge and capabilities. My experience was an 
            amazing adventure. Many challenges were faced both inside and outside
            of the office. From working with team managers to develop the best 
            product to overcoming language barriers to even suffering a broken foot,
            I not only accomplished my goal to improve my coding skills, but I also
            grew as an individual.

        <h2>After School App</h2>
        <p>
            I worked as a UI design intern for One Inc (the company
            behind After School App) in the Summers of 2015 and 2017. I 
            worked to develop products that catelyze high school and college 
            students to connect with each other. A feature that I worked on
            matches high school students by asking questions like 
            "Would you go eat cake in chinatown with ____?" If both students
            asked that question about eachother answered yes, they would be
            matched. In the first 3 months after being published on the After
            School App, the matching feature made over 500k matches. I also
            aided in the ideation and design of new products for the One Inc.
            I had the privilege to work for One Inc both in the first year of
            the After School App re-release, and in the later stage of a startup.
            I learned a lot about the tech industry, and startups. In my freetime,
            I improved my iOS development skills with one of my co-workers and 
            other interns around San Francisco (where my internships were). The
            biggest impact this experience had on me was that I realized how big 
            of an impact I could have on people by creating a good product.
            My experience was highly rewarding, and it spiked my drive to improve
            more people's lives.

        <h2>Adobe Inc</h2>
        <p>
            Through rigorous networking and incredible luck, I was able to 
            land an externship at Adobe in 2015. I had emailed all of my 
            parents'friends, my firends' parents, and the faculty and staff asking
            to send me contacts that they might have of people who work in
            Silicon Valley. At this time I already had a strong desire to
            pursue a career in tech, and I was determined to create learning
            opportunities. When I finally got in contact with an employee at 
            Adobe and asked about opportunities that they might know of, one
            of Adobe's executive's son was also looking to do an externship
            at Adobe. Serendipitously, I was able to join him for his
            externship. We learned about several different departments in Adobe,
            and got a true sense of what working at a large tech company would
            be like. I learned how I could create opportunities through hustle
            and grit.

        <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
        <p>
            In my freetime at school, I teach myself Swift and mobile development.
            I don't own a mac computer which is necessary to code in Swift, so 
            I spend extra hours on campus using one of the two mac computers hidden
            in the back of one of the campus computer labs. I made a simple Tic Tac Toe 
            game because I was inspired to help people interact in 
            medial times when they would normally just recluse themselves by doing
            something menial on their phone. I learned how difficult it is to publish 
            an app on the App Store (especially when you don't own the mac).
            I was driven to go through the entire process of getting the app 
            published for the pride of being able to say that I have an app on the 
            App Store. I am proud of how the game turned out, and I am looking to
            publish more apps in the near future.
