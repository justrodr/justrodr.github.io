        Hi I'm Justin Rodriguez. I am a computer science major and art minor at
        Texas A&M University, graduating May, 2020. I am an engineer who's passionate about the user experience. I am
        interested in mobile development, web development, and entrepreneurship amongst other things. I'm currently an iOS
        intern at Verizon Media working on the
        Yahoo Fantasy Sports app. My career goal is to bring focus and freedom to people’s lives
        through technology and innovation.
