        <p id="about">
            Hi I'm Justin Rodriguez. I am a computer science major and art minor at 
            Texas A&M University, graduating May, 2020. I am an aspiring 
            user experience engineer and entrepreneur amongst other things.
            My career goal is to bring focus and freedom to peopleâ€™s lives 
            through technology and innovation.

                    <h2>Paysafe Group</h2>
                        <p>
                        I spent the Summer of 2018 in Sofia, Bulgaria. I was a software 
                        engineering intern at Paysafe Group, a multinational payments
                        company. I spent my time building and implementing a web 
                        application that allows team managers in Paysafe's Bulgarian
                        Office (over 900 employees) to write team progress reports,
                        update Paysafe's Atlassian Jira database, and accurately 
                        delegate tasks.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                        In my free time, I learned to speak Bulgarian
                        (out of necesity), I learned more about mobile development from
                        one of my co-workers at Paysafe, and I even got to travel around
                        and adventure. This was my first time to Eastern Europe,
                        and I went alone without knowing anyone there. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        What propelled me
                        to venture to Bulgaria was that I was told that Paysafe's main
                        software development force and top developers were stationed in the Sofia
                        office. I have an insatiable appetite to learn, so it was a no-brainer
                        decision to make the trip from Texas. My goal for the Summer was to
                        double my coding knowledge and capabilities. My experience was an 
                        amazing adventure. Many challenges were faced both inside and outside
                        of the office. From working with team managers to develop the best 
                        product to overcoming language barriers to even suffering a broken foot,
                        I not only accomplished my goal to improve my coding skills, but I also
                        grew as an individual. 2018

                    <h2>After School App</h2>
                        <p>
                        I worked as a UI design intern for One Inc (the company
                        behind After School App) in the Summers of 2015 and 2017. I 
                        worked to develop products that catelyze high school and college 
                        students to connect with each other. 
                        A feature that I worked on
                        matches high school students by asking questions like 
                        "Would you go eat cake in chinatown with ____?" If both students
                        asked that question about each other answered yes, they would be
                        matched. In the first 3 months after being published on the After
                        School App, the matching feature made over 500k matches. I also
                        aided in the ideation and design of new products for the One Inc.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                        I had the privilege to work for One Inc both in the first year of
                        the After School App re-release, and in the later stage of a startup.
                        I learned a lot about the tech industry, and startups. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        In my freetime,
                        I improved my iOS development skills with one of my co-workers and 
                        other interns around San Francisco (where my internships were). The
                        biggest impact this experience had on me was that I realized how big 
                        of an impact I could have on people by creating a good product.
                        My experience was highly rewarding, and it spiked my drive to improve
                        more people's lives. 2015, 2017

                    <h2>Adobe Inc</h2>
                    <p>
                        Through rigorous networking and incredible luck, I was able to 
                        land an externship at Adobe in 2015. I had emailed all of my 
                        parents'friends, my firends' parents, and the faculty and staff asking
                        to send me contacts that they might have of people who work in
                        Silicon Valley. At this time I already had a strong desire to
                        pursue a career in tech, and I was determined to create learning
                        opportunities. When I finally got in contact with an employee at 
                        Adobe and asked about opportunities that they might know of, one
                        of Adobe's executive's son was also looking to do an externship
                        at Adobe. Serendipitously, I was able to join him for his
                        externship. We learned about several different departments in Adobe,
                        and got a true sense of what working at a large tech company would
                        be like. I learned how I could create opportunities through hustle
                        and grit. 2015

                    <p>
                        In my freetime at school, I teach myself Swift and mobile development.
                        I don't own a mac computer which is necessary to code in Swift, so 
                        I spend extra hours on campus using one of the two mac computers hidden
                        in the back of one of the campus computer labs. I made a simple Tic Tac Toe 
                        game because I was inspired to help people interact in 
                        medial times when they would normally just recluse themselves by doing
                        something menial on their phone. I learned how difficult it is to publish 
                        an app on the App Store (especially when you don't own the mac).
                        I was driven to go through the entire process of getting the app 
                        published for the pride of being able to say that I have an app on the 
                        App Store. I am proud of how the game turned out, and I am looking to
                        publish more apps in the near future. 2017 - Present

                    <h2>Braeswood Brand</h2>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to have many different companies under the overarching parent
                        brand - Braeswood. The mission of Braeswood is to add value 
                        to people's lives effectively and simply. In the same air as Pareto's law, I
                        believe that many products, services, and industries can become 
                        more valuable and effective by simplifying the process,
                        and focusing on the user. I have always been entrepreneurial growing up.
                        Some notable businesses of mine from my childhood are an origami business
                        in the 1st grade, a duct tape wallet business in the 5th grade, and
                        a downhill longboarding company in 10th grade. More recently, I have
                        been working on launching successful FBA product lines. From home decor
                        posters to makeup accessories, I have many failed attempts. Currently
                        I am working on launching a drumming product line that will
                        simplify drummers' shopping experience by providing fewer higher quality
                        options for drum sticks, and drum equipment.

                    <p>
                        I had the privelege of competing in two Aggies Invent Competitions.
                        Aggies Invent is like an entrepreneurial engineering hackathon
                        at Texas A&M University. In my second time competing, my team brought innovation
                        to the construction industry by developing a concrete formula that utilizes
                        recycled plastic. We came up with a business plan and sales pitch, and 
                        we presented our ideas to a panel of industry experts. My role in the team
                        was to conduct market research, and develop all of the presentation materials
                        (charts, graphs, presentation slides, video, etc...).
