                I am heading into the final weeks of my junior year at Texas A&M University. My teammates and I
                completed our minimum viable product for our rental home management tool for independent landlords as
                part of our software engineering class. Our professor said our website is the best project he has seen
                from any of his students both visually and functionally. We are extremely proud of our work and excited
                about the product. We are aiming to take this to market and further iterate on the product. We're
                calling the website, "Okapi Home Management." In my other class, a different set of teammates and I are
                working to finish up an mvp for our tool to help people with Alzheimer’s disease to record their
                memories.

                I ended up closing my drum equipment business... I had successfully gotten my first product (drum keys)
                listed on Amazon, and got around 10 reviews from friends and family. I made it to the first page for the
                keyword "drum keys." But ultimately I figured out that there wasn't a big enough market for drum
                equipment online for me to sustain the business. I learned a lot, and I am now pivoting to a new
                entrepreneurial endeavor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that closed my drum business. I am doing a lot of market research on the travel industry. I am
                hoping to help young people (17 - 25) travel more. Travel is something that I am really passionate
                about, and empowering young people to travel more would be really fulfilling to me. I have been doing
                research with Google keywords, Facebook Ads, and Surveys that I've been sending to people all over the
                country to figure out how I can best help students and young people travel. I hope to have an mvp out
                this Summer.

                I have several curricular and extracurricular projects in progress that I am really excited about. In
                school, I am working on developing a web app for rental home owners to manage their homes and automate
                maintenance. I am also working to create a memory record system to help Alzheimer’s patients and their
                loved
                ones record memories and triggers that caused the patient to recall that memory. Outside of school, I am
                attempting to create a drum brand that caters to hobbyist and student drummers. I am also getting closer
                to
                fluency in Spanish by practicing my listening and speaking with tutors over Skype. I am currently
                enjoying
                listening to the Brand Builder Podcast by Capitalism.com, and I am reading Money Master the Game by Tony
                Robbins.
