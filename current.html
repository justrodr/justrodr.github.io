        <h2>What I'm Up To</h2>
        <h4>23 February, 2019</h4>
        <p>
            I have several curricular and extracurricular projects in progress that I am really excited about. In
            school, I am working on developing a web app for rental home owners to manage their homes and automate
            maintenance. I am also working to create a memory record system to help Alzheimerâ€™s patients and their loved
            ones record memories and triggers that caused the patient to recall that memory. Outside of school, I am
            attempting to create a drum brand that caters to hobbyist and student drummers. I am also getting closer to
            fluency in Spanish by practicing my listening and speaking with tutors over Skype. I am currently enjoying
            listening to the Brand Builder Podcast by Capitalism.com, and I am reading Money Master the Game by Tony
            Robbins.
