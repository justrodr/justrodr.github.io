            I’m about halfway through Tony Robbins’s Book, Money Master the Game. I’m interested in learning about investing for the long term. I have a goal to be financially free by 30. From what I’ve learned so far, I believe I can put together a safe portfolio that will decently reliably generate 5% a year. With that in mind along with the ideal lifestyle that I want to live, I believe I will be financially free when my nest egg is grown to $6m.

            Lately I’ve been really enjoying the How I Built This Podcast, and Section 4 Podcast. How I Built This is about entrepreneurs who have built household name companies like Lyft, Betterment, and Airbnb. Section 4 takes a business perspective on the tech industry. Scott Galloway’s commentary is really insightful and thought-provoking.

            For the past year, I have been thinking about how I can make travel more accessible and attainable for college students. College students are often broke and only have time to travel during the busiest and most expensive times: weekends and holidays. I recently released a big update for my app, Weekend Trip, which is my first idea to help students travel more. The app currently has 150+ users, and I am learning how I can better solve this problem.

                Tomorrow is the last day of my internship at Verizon Media Yahoo Fantasy Sports. I have had a blast. Most
                of my contributions were for the new Yahoo Fantasy Sports game, Best Ball. I built several features for
                the iOS app from scratch working in all of the different layers of the app's architecture. I also wrote unit
                tests for half of the Best Ball models, and I even served as the release manager for Best Ball on the App Store!
                The Yahoo Fantasy App is the #1 rated fantasy sports app. It was an honor to work on the app, and to contribute
                to the brand new game.

                I am currently looking for a full time position next year. I will be mostly applying to iOS, mobile, web
                frontend, and software engineering positions. My goal is to find a company that is solving problems that
                I am passionate about, that has a super fun culture, and that has a great location.

                This Summer I was able to publish two apps on the App Store: Drink Water and Weekend Trip. I am really proud of
                both, and I am looking forward to maintaining them and sharing them with all of my friends.

                I am heading into the final weeks of my junior year at Texas A&M University. My teammates and I
                completed our minimum viable product for our rental home management tool for independent landlords as
                part of our software engineering class. Our professor said our website is the best project he has seen
                from any of his students both visually and functionally. We are extremely proud of our work and excited
                about the product. We are aiming to take this to market and further iterate on the product. We're
                calling the website, "Okapi Home Management." In my other class, a different set of teammates and I are
                working to finish up an mvp for our tool to help people with Alzheimer’s disease to record their
                memories.

                I ended up closing my drum equipment business... I had successfully gotten my first product (drum keys)
                listed on Amazon, and got around 10 reviews from friends and family. I made it to the first page for the
                keyword "drum keys." But ultimately I figured out that there wasn't a big enough market for drum
                equipment online for me to sustain the business. I learned a lot, and I am now pivoting to a new
                entrepreneurial endeavor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that closed my drum business. I am doing a lot of market research on the travel industry. I am
                hoping to help young people (17 - 25) travel more. Travel is something that I am really passionate
                about, and empowering young people to travel more would be really fulfilling to me. I have been doing
                research with Google keywords, Facebook Ads, and Surveys that I've been sending to people all over the
                country to figure out how I can best help students and young people travel. I hope to have an mvp out
                this Summer.

                This Summer, I will be interning at Yahoo in Sunnyvale, California on the Fantasy Sports iOS team.

                I have several curricular and extracurricular projects in progress that I am really excited about. In
                school, I am working on developing a web app for rental home owners to manage their homes and automate
                maintenance. I am also working to create a memory record system to help Alzheimer’s patients and their
                loved
                ones record memories and triggers that caused the patient to recall that memory. Outside of school, I am
                attempting to create a drum brand that caters to hobbyist and student drummers. I am also getting closer
                to
                fluency in Spanish by practicing my listening and speaking with tutors over Skype. I am currently
                enjoying
                listening to the Brand Builder Podcast by Capitalism.com, and I am reading Money Master the Game by Tony
                Robbins.
