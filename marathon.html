              In my sophomore year of high school, I decided to take on a bet with my dad. My dad always offered a bet with my brother and I: if we could beat him in a race, we could call him “old man”. My dad is extremely fast. Beating him in a short distance race was nearly impossible. I decided that my strategy would be to beat him in a marathon.

              I trained for 20 weeks, while also playing school and club soccer. My training runs were often 2 -4 hours, and greuling in the Houston heat. Running is a sport of the mind. I often found myself having dialogues with myself, negotiating on whether I should stop or not.

              I love big challenges. Exercising my mental fortitude in the marathon was extremely rewarding. In the actual race, I hit “the wall” (the metaphorical spot in the race where your body shuts down) at mile 18. There were 8 miles left to run. With the clock working against me, I pushed myself forward. A friend that I saw at mile 20 said I was crying. I had forgotten about the bet at that point. I was simply determined to finish what I set out to do.

              I finished the race in 4.5 hours, and I won the bet. The marathon was the most painful experience that I have put myself through, and I am so grateful for it.
