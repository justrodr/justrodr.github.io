            I worked as a UI design intern for One Inc (the company
            behind After School App) in the Summers of 2015 and 2017. I
            worked to develop products that catelyze high school and college
            students to connect with each other.
            A feature that I worked on
            matches high school students by asking questions like
            "Would you go eat cake in chinatown with ____?" If both students
            asked that question about each other answered yes, they would be
            matched. In the first 3 months after being published on the After
            School App, the matching feature made over 500k matches. I also
            aided in the ideation and design of new products for the One Inc.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had the privilege to work for One Inc both in the first year of
            the After School App re-release, and in the later stage of a startup.
            I learned a lot about the tech industry, and startups.

            In my freetime,
            I improved my iOS development skills with one of my co-workers and
            other interns around San Francisco (where my internships were). The
            biggest impact this experience had on me was that I realized how big
            of an impact I could have on people by creating a good product.
            My experience was highly rewarding, and it spiked my drive to improve
            more people's lives.
