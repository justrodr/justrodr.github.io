      <h4>November 1, 2019: The Ethical Responsibility of Shared Economy Businesses</h4>
      <p>
        Shared economy businesses (also referred to as “sharing economy” “collaborative economy” “peer economy”) are platforms that facilitate peer-to-peer transactions of goods and services. Sharing economies have existed for thousands of years (Chappelow). Since humans’ transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture, communities of people have shared and traded goods with each other (A-connect). In more recent history, the internet drastically unleashed the power of the sharing economy by connecting people from across the world. The first example of a shared economy internet business is Ebay. In 1995, Ebay fundamentally changed how people sold and purchased goods, by coordinating with the actual stakeholders on either side of a transaction (A-connect).

        At first glance, internet sharing economies are incredibly innovative and empowering for people. Sharing economies gives economic freedom to individuals, and democratizes much of how today’s economy functions. In this essay, I examine two present-day shared economy businesses that have grown to be iconic, society-changing platforms: Uber and Airbnb. For those who are unfamiliar with these companies, Uber is a ride sharing app that connects willing car owners with people who need transportation. Uber provides a platform for car owners to earn money by driving people to and from places. More broadly, Uber can be referred to as a ride sharing app. Uber takes a cut from the transactions between riders and drivers connected on its platform. Airbnb is a platform that allows people to make money by renting out extra rooms or entire homes to people needing short term accomodations. Airbnb stands for air bed and breakfast. Locals can rent out their extra spaces to travelers, and Airbnb takes a cut of the money exchanged on their platform.

        It would be difficult to argue that sharing economy businesses like Uber and Airbnb are not a net-positive for society. Both have added an immense amount of innovation to their industries respectively. Ride-sharing and space-sharing both serve as amazing boosts to the economy, and allow owners of assets, like cars and homes, to earn money on their investments. Both also provide amazing community-sourced services to people for a fraction of the price of traditional taxis and hotels.

        With that said, shared economy companies come with negatives also. Uber has run into many ethical issues surrounding its pricing of rides and vetting process of drivers. For example, in 2014, during a crisis in Australia, due to a spike in demand for rides out of the crisis area, Uber charged people in the crisis area $100+ to escape danger (Ananny). Uber has also been caught up in many legal cases, where drivers have raped passengers, and where drivers have accidentally hit passengers or other people. Airbnb has had similar issues with hosts on its platform.

        Are sharing economy companies like Uber and Airbnb off the hook for taking responsibility of negative consequences of their platforms? In this essay, I aim to answer to what extent shared economy companies like Uber and Airbnb are ethically responsible for the transactions and effects of their platforms by examining the ethical issue of Uber with the categorization of drivers as either employees or contractors, and the ethical issue of Airbnb with the invasion of tourists on traditionally residential areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the largest issues that Uber faces, currently, is how to categorize and pay its drivers. Part of Uber’s large success is due to the fact that it offers cheaper rides than traditional taxis. Uber can offer low rates because of its categorization of drivers as independent contractors and not as employees. Unlike taxi companies, Uber is not legally obligated to pay drivers minimum wage. Uber allows for drivers to make up their own hours, and work whenever they want. Despite these freedoms provided, should Uber be responsible for making sure that drivers are paid a living wage? What protections and pay is Uber morally responsible for to provide to its drivers? Increasing pay or protections for Uber could be detrimental to its business, as rides would cost more or margins would decrease.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the largest issues that Airbnb faces is its disruption of local communities. Home owners from anywhere in the world can rent out their homes on Airbnb, but with that has come many issues with residential areas being flooded with tourists, and landlords kicking out their tenants to host tourists on Airbnb. City governments like Barcelona’s city government have filed complaints with Airbnb, claiming that Airbnb has only brought disruption and chaos to its neighborhoods (Guttentag). Many landlords in touristy cities are finding that they can make more money doing short term rentals on Airbnb than leasing to locals (Steves). This has caused many locals to be dislocated either through a rise in rent prices or through landlords terminating leases (Steves). Should Airbnb be ethically responsible for the disruption of residential areas? Or can Airbnb morally choose to not intervene with homeowners renting out their homes?
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to be clear that this essay is examining the morality of sharing economy companies and not their legal obligations. Legal rights and responsibilities are often based off of moral rights and responsibilities, but just because a company like Uber or Airbnb might legally have a right or legally not be responsible for its stakeholders does not mean that right or responsibility is moral (Miller).
      </p>

        Since capitalism is largely premised on the aim of companies and individuals to better themselves, the first and most obvious ethical framework to use to examine sharing economy companies in a free market is ethical egoism. Egoism is a normative ethical theory that states that individuals should act in their own best interest (Miller). For Uber and Airbnb, an egoist could argue that they should do their best to maximize their profits while still preserving the longevity of their companies by somewhat addressing the issues that they face with drivers and neighborhoods. Uber has already made ethically egoist moves like supporting the rewriting of Assembly Bill 5 in California. Assembly Bill 5 is a gig workers protection legislation that has the potential to drastically hurt or help Uber’s business. Uber publicly supports the bill, but has specific clauses that would be more beneficial to their business in a petition titled “Protect Ride Sharing in California.” In this petition, Uber proposes to pay drivers $21 per hour while driving, paid time off, and sick leave (Dickey). With this public support and petition, Uber both maintains their public relations while also advocating for a bill that does not hurt its business. Airbnb has taken a less sly egoist approach, by simply disregarding its issues with local governments and communities, and continuing to allow listings in residential areas even if governments have ruled it illegal. Cities like New York and Barcelona have made Airbnb illegal under many circumstances. In New York City, it is illegal to rent an airbnb for less than 30 days. And in Barcelona, hosts must have a license to rent out their home, and licenses require hosts to follow strict regulations. A report from the New York state attorney general reported that 72% of Airbnb rentals in New York City were illegal. And the city of Barcelona fined Airbnb €600,000 for continuing to list unlicensed homes on their platform. €600,000 is tiny, however, compared to the $175 million in annual revenue that Airbnb made in Barcelona in the last year (Airbnb). Through the lens of an egoist, Airbnb’s actions are perfectly ethical. Despite legal fines and public complaints, Airbnb is better off not changing their business rather than changing.

        Are Airbnb and Uber selfish for their ethical egoist actions? Or are they simply aiming to preserve their business to continue to provide innovation for society? This distinction is important when determining each companies’ morality through the lens of a kantian ethicist. The basic premise of kantian ethics is that an action is deemed moral or immoral based not on the consequences of an action but on the intentions of those actions (Miller). If Uber is in fact supporting Assembly Bill 5 and advocating for specific clauses in Assembly Bill 5 to properly take care of its drivers and customers, and if Airbnb is truly aiming to work with homeowners specifically to give them more freedom to rent out their homes, then Uber and Airbnb are moral in the eyes of a kantian ethicist. It is important to consider each companies’ mission statements to understand their motives. Uber’s mission statement is “We ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion” (Uber). Airbnb's mission is to help create a world where you can belong anywhere and where people can live in a place, instead of just traveling to it (Airbnb). Neither mission statements mention the providers of the companies’ services. Uber’s mission statement does not mention a commitment to its drivers, and Airbnb’s mission statement does not mention the home owners listing their own homes. Each business is more focused on building an experience for customers. Is this moral? If one tries to apply a maxim that all shared economy companies focus on providing the best experience for customers and not necessarily for resource providers, is the general outcome good.
      </p>

        Sharing economy companies are interesting because they have stakeholders on both sides of their businesses. With that said, don’t regular companies have stakeholders on both sides also? Any physical product company that outsources manufacturing has those manufacturers as stakeholders in their business also, but it is easy to argue that morally, those companies’ main focus should be on their customers. In that sense, I argue that the maxim extends to all companies and holds that the main focus and purpose of companies should be to serve their customers. Another maxim could apply that all companies ought to consider all stakeholders when making business decisions, but when at a crossroad between serving customers or catering to the needs of resource providers or environment, companies’ have a moral obligation to favor their customers. For that reason, I ascertain that Uber is moral for avoiding classifying its drivers as employees and for petitioning for their specific clauses in Assembly Bill 5. And I also believe that Airbnb is ethical in its decision to continue to provide authentic local housing experiences to travelers despite its negative effects on communities.
      </p>

        Because new internet-based shared economy businesses bring so much innovation to society, one could also argue that virtuous in the pursuit of creating a better world. It is undeniable that Uber and Airbnb have drastically improved society. The amount of freedom and empowerment that each service provides for riders, renters, drivers, and home owners is incredible. Despite issues with implementation and growth, the positives of shared economy businesses should not be overlooked. Services like Uber, Airbnb not only provide amazing services to people, but they also greatly expand the efficient use of society's resources. One report from Yahoo Finance showed that today’s society’s cars are parked 95% of the car’s lifetime (Morris). With ridesharing, the world not only puts cars to better use, but also provides opportunities to people who might not be able to commit to a full-time or committed-time job.
      </p>

        I think it is easy to point out the issues and problems that sharing economy companies pose. But to argue that sharing economy companies are inherently immoral is difficult to prove. Companies should ethically consider all of its stakeholders when making business decisions. And based on the actions of Uber and Airbnb, I would support the notion that they are working hard to ensure the well being of all of their stakeholders. It is hard to please everyone, and with great innovations come growing pains and implementation learning experiences. The pursuit of innovation, and the betterment of society as a whole is a noble cause, and because of that, sharing economy companies have a responsibility to their shareholders, but deserves slack during the implementation and growth of their innovations.
