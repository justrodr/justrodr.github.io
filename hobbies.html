              For most of my life I played drums and soccer. Iâ€™m a jazz and blues drummer, and I played club soccer through middle school and high school. Music and soccer are hobbies that I maintain now that are central to my character. I learned how to think creatively and spontaneously through jazz and blues, and I learned discipline through soccer.
